Overview
========

The project aims to create a retro-style 8-bit computer based on the 65(c)02 microprocessor. It includes custom-designed main board, development board, 
backplane boards, various peripheral cards, various helper boards, and a simple operating system.

The project is designed using KiCad for PCB design and is open-source, allowing enthusiasts to contribute and modify the designs. The boards are manufactured 
by JLCPCB and use a combination of surface-mount and through-hole components.
