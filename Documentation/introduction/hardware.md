Hardware
========

The hardware consists of several custom-designed PCBs. These are divided into the following categories:

- **Boards**: The main board, development board, backplane boards and other peripheral boards.
- **Cards**: Various peripheral cards for plugging into the backplane or main board card slot(s).
- **Helpers**: Additional boards that provide specific functionalities or interfaces.

**Boards**:

- **Backplane Board**: A backplane board that provides multiple card slots for peripheral cards and connects to the main board via a ribbon cable.
- **Backplane Board Pro**: An enhanced version of the backplane board with additional features.
- **Front Panel Board**: A board that provides a front panel interface with switches and LEDs for controlling and monitoring the system.
- **Main Board**: The main board that contains the 65(c)02 CPU, memory, memory decoding ICs, one peripheral card slot, and a bus connector.

**Cards**:
